## Welcome to G3WKW home page

This is a new test site to see how easy it is to maintain using MarkDown .md files. 
lnitially I plan to document the build of my **M0NKA mcHF SDR V0.7**
Otherwise I would be doing this on Facebook where it would have been accessible only to friends and thoroughly bored the vast majority of them. Hopefully this will be accessible to the many others who have an interest in this project.


And here is my [mcHF project page](mcHF.md).
For other things I will have a [Project page](project.md)

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/G3WKW/G3WKW.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.


Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/G3WKW/G3WKW.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
