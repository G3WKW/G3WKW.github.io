# Building the Case



Chris sells a nicely made case. Unfortunately they are a bit like hens teeth.  So I made my own retro style, though it is best described as a prototype which would improve greatly on a second build.  First it is bolted down to a substantial piece of aluminium same size as the PCB.  A mahogany frame (scrap from a conservatory build 30 years ago which I knew would come in handy one day)


First a couple of end views taken so I could print them actual size as drilling templates
The left hand view which has a lot of jack sockets. Obvious on the left is the antenna BNC connector, then the mini USB for loading bootloader, OFB programming or for computer cnnectof both CAT and audio simultaneously. The larger USB is for loading software as a .bin file from a memory stick. The bottom RF board has the power in an accessory connector and the morse key/paddle connector. On the central Logic board there is a headphone jack, a microphone/PTT jack and line out and line in jacks.

The right hand side is simpler having only 3 rotate and push controls.

The buttons were provided by my grand daughter as old felt tip pens cut into short lengths and filled with hot melt glue and an embedded label
