# Building the Case

Chris sells a nicely made case. Unfortunately they are a bit like hens teeth.  So I made my own retro style, though it is best described as a prototype which would improve greatly on a second build.  First it is bolted down to a substantial piece of aluminium same size as the PCB.  A mahogany frame (scrap from a conservatory build 30 years ago which I knew would come in handy one day)

A front panel (made of hardboard)

Has a backing panel behind.

to sandwich the button carrier plate (top of an icecream box

The buttons were provided by my grand daughter as old felt tip pens cut into short lengths and filled with hot melt glue and an embedded label
