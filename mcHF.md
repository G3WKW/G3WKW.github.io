# mcHF
## ..Software defined radio kit

I have been aware of the mcHF project for several months and would probably have bought the clone when it was advertised by Martin Lynch a few months back. Fortunately they pulled it from the market due to license issues and I have been waiting for the full kit to reappear on the [M0NKA Order Page](http://www.m0nka.co.uk/?page_id=740) rather than purchase one of the Chinese clones which generally have poor reviews.

Meanwhile I found the [Git Hub UHSDR page](https://github.com/df8oe/UHSDR) with the active software development and became aware of the parallel hardware development [OVI40](https://www.amateurfunk-sulingen.de/ovi40-sdr-en/#start) in Germany which looks like it will be a better product, but is not shipping yet. 

The UHSDR page has an excellent [Wiki](https://github.com/df8oe/UHSDR/wiki) and I was able to set up the Eclipse IDE and fork and clone the software and build it.  However I will no doubt download a binary for the first build.

So far there has been little documentation about the v0.7 that I am expecting to arrive tomorrow.  So I plan to photograph and publish as much as I can while I build, and hope it will be of interest and use to others.  Publishing this is also getting me practice in using Git which will be needed if I ever get to want to play with the software.
