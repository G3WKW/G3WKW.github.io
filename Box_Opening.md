as you can see the partially populated PCB are wrapped in antistatic bubble wrap an the components to be added are in three separate packs, one for each board. separately packed is the loudspeaker and the LCD display module.

Here are the three boards

Note that the kit does not include the RF output transistors, but a quick dash to eBay located a pair for Â£15, beware of counterfeits!

Here is the Logic board

Each component pack has a full list of contents and each pack is very clearly labelled.
