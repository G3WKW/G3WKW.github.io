# The kit arrived

## The kit duly arrived and was well packed.

as you can see the partially populated PCB are wrapped in antistatic bubble wrap an the components to be added are in three separate packs, one for each board. separately packed is the loudspeaker and the LCD display module.

Here are the three boards

.... and a closer view of the RF board

Note that the kit does not include the RF output transistors, but a quick dash to eBay located a pair for Â£15, beware of counterfeits!

Here is the Logic board

Each component pack has a full list of contents and each pack is very clearly labelled.

 But no details like polarity of LED so if you do not know that the long lead is the +ve then Google is your friend.

At this point I became engrossed with the building and took no more construction photos! There is a dozen or so toroids to be wound and a bifilar wound transformer. Perhaps the hardest items to mount were a couple of surface mount construction transformers and surface mount relays but nothing required tweezers or microscopes, though an extra pair of reading glasses comes in handy at times
